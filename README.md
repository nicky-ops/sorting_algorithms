# 0x1B. C - Sorting algorithms & Big O
A <em>sorting algorithm</em> is an algorithm tha puts elements of a list into an order.
Frequently used  orders include:
* Numerical order an dlexicographical order
* Ascending or descending order

The output of any sorting algorithm must satisfy two conditions:
1. The output is in monotonic order
2. The output is a permutation

The input data should be stored in a data structure that allows random access rather than one that allows only sequential access only, for optimum efficiency.

## Classification of Sorting algorithims.
* Computational complexity
* Memory usage
* Recursion
* Whether or not they are a comparison sort
* Stability
* General method: insertion, exchange, selection, merging
* Whether algorithm is serial or parallel
* Adaptability: whether or not the presortedness of the input affects the running time.
* Online e.g Isertion sort that is online can sort a constant stream of input.
